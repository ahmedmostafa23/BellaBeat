###The Analysis Problem
Problem: explore the use data of one of our health products and app to find insights, patterns and trends about the users’ usage to be used in making high-level marketing recommendations.  
The dataset is data collected by the app/device.

#####Potential Questions that need to be answered:
- What do they do the most/least with their product?  
- How long do they wear it everyday?  
- What is the thing they enjoy most/least about their product?  
- What features seem missing that we can add to the product?

####Required characteristics of the dataset:  
1. Population: there have been 100000 sold Bellabeat Leaf units from 2013 to 2017. I’m going to assume 100000 unique subjects.
with a margin of error of 10%, a confidence level of 10% I should have a sample size of at least 68 users.
2. Detailed non aggregate daily data of the usage, with intervals.
3. Rating about features of the product, or the product as a whole.
4. Also includes male users if possible.
5. Women of different ages, race, nationality, and physically or mentally challenged women, as well as women of several income brackets
