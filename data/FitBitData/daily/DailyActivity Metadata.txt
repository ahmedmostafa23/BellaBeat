very, moderately, lightly and sedentary_active_distance are the same as above but a general guideline:
-->very: manual agricultural work or competitive athletic training, taking yourself to the absolute limits in terms of strength, not endurance
-->moderately: Moving frequently through the day (construction work, stocking shelves, cleaning, etc.) and/or moderate exercise
-->lightly: eating or gentle walking or light exercises e.g. moving arms or yoga 
-->sedentary: being awake not moving at all. sitting down, lying on couch, working on a laptop or paper or whatever.
constraint: they all need to add up to total distance.

xxxx_active_minutes: these are the number of minutes in a day spent at a certain activity level. all of the active minutes column should add up to 1440. if the user wore the FitBit for 24h
-->very, moderately, lightly and sedentary
-->there are 1440 minutes in a day.
-type: interval (minutes)

schema info:
each subject(device_id) can have more than one record. each record must have a different dayy.
