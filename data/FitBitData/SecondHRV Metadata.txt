hrv: Heart Rate Variability
Reference link : https://ouraring.com/blog/what-is-heart-rate-variability/
Unlike heart rate in bmp (beats per minute) which kind of aggregates the beats in said minute. 120bpm does not mean that the heart beats 2 times per second (thatâ€™s the average), but the time between the beats could be 0.9s, 1.1, 1.15, 0.95 and etc.
High HRV is associated with rest-and-digest, general fitness (moderate activity), and good recovery
Low HRV is associated with fight-or-flight, stress (dehydration, alcohol, late meals, general stress, hot bedroom), illness, or overtraining, but also high intensity exercise
A normal HRV for adults can range anywhere from below 20 to over 200 milliseconds, to properly find what is "normal" you need to measure the individual's baseline. there is a baseline for night time, and one for day time. night time is more important because it purely captures my body. not my thoughts, food, exercise, anxiety and etc.
-->the trends I should be looking for here are "is the HRV getting higher or lower with each day?", "is it okay in general?"

RMS (root mean square) i.e. you take the root of the mean of the squares of the values. steps:
0-measure the time between each 2 successive heartbeats
1-calculate the difference between the time between the successive heartbeats in ms
2-square said differences
3-sum the differences
4-divide by n-1 or n
5-square root of everything

Total record count: 2483658
does not have a single null count
does not have full duplicates.

schema info:
each subject (device_id) can have several records in the columns at different date/time with different HRV.
