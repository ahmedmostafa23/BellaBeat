Dataset Title: Fitbase data
Description: FitBit Data collected from an online survey from 30 users.

Dataset owner: Mobius
date created & Last updated: December 2016
Version: N/A	
License: common license
Source: Amazon Mechanical Turk online survey
Context: No idea why the data was collected. The data shows the health/activity metrics for FitBit users, such as sleep, steps and etc. over several days.

Attribute information

id: this is a computer generated number. each FitBit user has his/her own unique number.
-type: Integer
-format: 10 digit integer
-constraints: Unique, not null
-length/regex constraints : 10 digits

datetime (interval_start): This is the date/time/datetime at which an activity started, something was summarized/measured, or was done.
-type: date/time/datetime
-format: not yet specified
-precision/range: seconds are just seconds. no ms or anything. they are all values in 2016.

weight: this is the user’s body mass in kg when he weighed him/herself at the specified date.
-type: decimal
-format: decimal to 1 decimal place
-constraints: none
-units: kilogram (kg)

bfp: (body fat percentage) this is the user’s ratio of fat mass/ total mass at the time of weighing.
-type: percentage
-format: percentage really
-constraints :none
-units: none (kg/kg)

BMI: body mass index, a value derived from the mass and height of a person, this value serves as an easy way to judge if a person’s body is overweight, underweight, or healthy. (not to be used by pregnant women or body builders)
BMI of 25 is normal. anything over is overweight, anything under is underweight.
-type: decimal
-format: 2 decimal places
-constraints: none
-units: kg/m^2
-equation: mass in kg/ (height in m) ^2

LogId??

HRV : Heart rate variability: This is the variation in time between heartbeats. heart rate data is used to calculate HRV several times per second.
-type: integer:
-format: no decimals
-constraints: n/a
-units: none
-equation: RMSSD

calories: this is the amount of calories burnt in the time interval, starting with the given time. e.g. if table is minute calories, then this is the amount of calories burnt in one minute, starting from the start time.
-type: decimal
-format & precision: 4 decimal places
-constraints: none
-units: Kcal

intensity: this is the activity intensity rating from 0-3 in the given interval
-type: integer
-format & precision: whole number
-constraints: none
-units: none
-set membership: {0, 1, 2, 3}

sleep_value: this is a number from 1-3 that represents the “depth” of sleep at the given interval
-type: integer
-format & precision: whole number
-constraints: none
-units: none
-set membership: {1, 2, 3}

METs: metabolic equivalent of tasks measured based on oxygen consumption. METs = 2 means you’re now burning twice as much calories as you would just sitting down quietly doing nothing. while the MET not doing anything is = 1
-type: integer
-format & precision: whole number
-constraints: none
-range: >= 1, < 16 (16 is pretty much professional athlete at the last minute of the race type of intensity)
-units: energy/energy (none)
-formula: calories burnt in interval of task/ calories burnt in same interval of task while sitting quietly not doing anything.

steps: this is the number of steps walked/ran by the user in the given interval
-type: integer
-format & precision: whole number
-constraints: none
-units: steps lol

logged_activity_distance and tracker_distance

total distance: total distance walked/ran by the user in one day. this is also the sum of very_active_distance + moderately_active_distance+ light_active_distance. which are self-explanatory.
for light walking, 1km = 1250~1550 walking steps
-type: decimal
-format & precision: not yet
-constraints: none
-units: km

xxxx_active_minutes: these are the number of minutes in a day spent at a certain activity level. all of the active minutes column should add up to 1440. if the user wore the FitBit for 24h
there are 1440 minutes in a day.
-type: interval (minutes)
-format and precision: integer, whole number
-constraints: sum of all active minutes column <= 1440
-units: minutes
