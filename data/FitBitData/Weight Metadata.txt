weight_kg: this is the user’s body mass in kg when he weighed him/herself at the specified date. the world average human weight is 62kg
-weight on its own is a bad metric to judge how close a person is to ideal or healthy. it needs to be combined with body fat percentage and BMI to put height and fat into consideration.

bfr: (body fat ratio) this is the user’s ratio of fat mass/ total mass at the time of weighing.
-->the healthy range for men is <=17, while for women is 14 <= <= 24

bmi: body mass index, a value derived from the mass and height of a person, this value serves as an easy way to judge if a person’s body is overweight, underweight, or healthy. (not to be used by pregnant women or body builders)
BMI of 25 is normal. anything over is overweight, anything under is underweight.

table does not have a single null value in any cell.

Table schema information:
-The table has 8 unique device owners who weight themselves once, or several times in the month from 12-4-2016 to 12-5-2016. so each device_id should appear multiple times each with a different weight (or the same) value with different dates and/or times.
